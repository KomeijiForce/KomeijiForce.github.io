I am a second Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). Before Ph.D. I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science at SJTU.

Research Interest
------
My current focus is on the interaction between frozen large language models (LLMs) and external resources, including plain texts, annotated datasets, task-specific models... Followings are examples of questions I am interested in:

1. Are LLMs more efficient guiders than humans to teach smaller models on new tasks?
2. How to guide LLMs to react following human expectation according to an annotated dataset?
3. How to make LLMS strictly follow rules in specific domains, especially medical?
4. Do LLMs develop abilities that do not explicitly appear in the training corpus? If so, how?

Collaboration
------
I am open to any type of collaboration! As long as you have the passion, I would not mind to support you from the very beginning! Please feel free to contact me via my email! :-)
