I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science at SJTU, advised by Professor [Hai Zhao](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/zhaohai/). 

Research Interest
------

My research interests are knowledge discovery, parameterization, and generation of large language models. I aim to build **knowledgeable** LLMs (especially as experts in unique domains) with **Diversity**, **Generalizability**, and **Fine-granularity**.


### Discovery: Mining useful knowledge (texts/spans) with minimal supervision

1. Text Mining: ([CoTAM@ACL2024F](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.1/), [Incubator@EMNLP2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10877), [TextGraft@EMNLP2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11115))
2. Span Extraction: ([NDD@ACL2023F](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.694/), [X-NER@EMNLP2023F](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.908/), [MetaIE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00457))
3. Text Representation: ([InBedder@ACL2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.27/))

### Parameterization: Understanding the limitation of LLMs in knowledge memorization/generalization.

1. The diversity issue caused by unembedding parameters in LLMs ([ICN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02284))

### Generation: Learn LLMs to perform diverse open-ended generation following massive constraints.

1. Fine-granularize role-playing faithfulness under massive constraints ([APC@NeurIPS2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07726))
