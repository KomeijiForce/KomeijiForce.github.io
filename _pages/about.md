I am a second-year Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). Before my Ph.D., I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science at SJTU, advised by Professor [Hai Zhao](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/zhaohai/). 

Research Interest
------
My current focus is on personalized or persona-driven LLMs for usage with minimal effort. The following are examples of questions I am interested in:


### Personalized LLM

1. Personalized Data Synthesis (Controllable Generation): How to synthesize user-centric data that can be used to instruction-tune LLMs to understand user demands and perform different jobs? ([X-NER](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.908/), [CoTAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07099), [Incubator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10877), [Text Grafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11115))
2. Meta-learning: How to develop intermediate checkpoints well adapted to a large ground of downstream tasks? ([MetaIE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00457))
3. Efficient Representation: How to use LLMs to produce representations (e.g., Text Embeddings) for more efficient inference? ([InBedder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09642))

### Persona-driven LLM

1. How can we customize LLMs based on a large number of persona statements while still maintaining the response quality? ([APC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07726))
