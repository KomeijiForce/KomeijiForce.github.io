I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science at SJTU, advised by Professor [Hai Zhao](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/zhaohai/). 

Research Interest
------

### Minimal Supervision: Building a system with minimal user input (based on LLM)

1. Representation-based ([NDD@ACL2023F](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.694/), [X-NER@EMNLP2023F](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.908/))
2. Generator (LLM)-based ([CoTAM@ACL2024F](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.1/), [Incubator@EMNLP2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10877))
3. Hybrid ([TextGraft@EMNLP2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11115))

### Language Modeling: Understanding how LLM solves problems by next token prediction.

1. Generative Rerepresentation ([InBedder@ACL2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.27/))
2. View LM as a retriever ([ICN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02284))

### Role-playing: Learn LLMs to follow persona statements to interact with users.

1. Fine-granularize role-playing faithfulness ([APC@NeurIPS2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07726))
