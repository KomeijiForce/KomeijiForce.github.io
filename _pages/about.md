I am a second-year Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). Before my Ph.D., I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science at SJTU, advised by Professor [Hai Zhao](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/zhaohai/). 

Research Interest
------
My current focus is on personalizing LLMs for usage with minimal effort. The following are examples of questions I am interested in:

1. Personalized Data Synthesis: How to synthesize user-centric data that can be used to instruction-tune LLMs to understand user demands and perform different jobs? ([CoTAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07099), [Incubator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10877))
2. Meta-learning: How to develop intermediate checkpoints well adapted to a large ground of downstream tasks? ([MetaIE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00457))
3. Efficient Representation: How to use LLMs to produce representations (e.g., Text Embeddings) for more efficient inference? ([InBedder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09642))
