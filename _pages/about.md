I am a second Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). Before Ph.D. I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science at SJTU.

Research Interest
------
My current focus is on the interaction between large language models (LLMs) with word/span/text embeddings. Followings are examples of questions I am interested in:

1. (LLM-aided) Fancier Embedders: How to build embedders with LLMs to implment functions more than semantic similarity evaluation?
2. LLMs as pitfalls detector: Are there undiscovered pitfalls in traditional embedders that can be detected by LLMs?
3. Potential of Embedders: What are some undiscovered tasks that embeddings are much more efficent/effective than language models?
4. LLM-oriented Retreival Augmentation: What kind of embeddings for retrievers are prefered by LLMs, still by textual similarity?

Collaboration
------
I am open to any type of collaboration! As long as you have the passion, I would not mind to support you from the very beginning! Please feel free to contact me via my email! :-)
